## Data Sources

The application uses two datasets:

### Primary Dataset: QS Rankings 2025-2026 (`qs_2025_2026.csv`)
- 1,501 universities worldwide
- Complete ranking data with all performance indicators
- Khalifa University's current performance metrics
- Full country and regional information

### Secondary Dataset: Projected Scores (`projected_scores (1).csv`)
- 599 universities with projected performance indicators
- Score projections based on performance modeling
- Note: Khalifa University is not included in this dataset

## How It Works

### Current Rankings Analysis
1. **Load Current Data**: The application loads KU's current scores from the QS CSV file
2. **Interactive Adjustment**: Users can modify scores using sliders (0-100 range)
3. **Recalculation**: The system recalculates overall scores using updated QS weighting methodology
4. **Ranking Comparison**: All universities are re-ranked based on the new calculated scores
5. **Results Display**: Shows KU's new position and surrounding universities with rank change indicators

### Projected Scores Analysis
1. **Dataset Check**: Verifies if KU data is available in projected scores
2. **Graceful Handling**: Shows informative message when data is not available
3. **User Guidance**: Provides clear direction to use current rankings for analysis

## Technical Implementation

- **Backend**: Django 5.2.4 with pandas for data processing
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS and JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite for development (models included for future enhancements)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas DataFrame operations for efficient ranking calculations
- **UI/UX**: Tabbed interface for seamless dataset switching

## Key Files

- `ranking_analyzer/views.py`: Main application logic and ranking calculations
- `ranking_analyzer/templates/ranking_analyzer/home.html`: Interactive web interface with tabs
- `ranking_analyzer/models.py`: Database models for university data
- `qs_2025_2026.csv`: Source data with all university rankings
- `projected_scores (1).csv`: Projected performance scores dataset

## Updated Ranking Calculation

The application uses an updated weighting system based on QS methodology:

```python
score_weights = {
    'SCORE_AR': 0.3,   # Academic Reputation - 30%
    'SCORE_ER': 0.15,  # Employer Reputation - 15%
    'SCORE_FS': 0.10,  # Faculty Student Ratio - 10%
    'SCORE_CPF': 0.2,  # Citations per Faculty - 20%
    'SCORE_IF': 0.05,  # International Faculty - 5%
    'SCORE_IS': 0.05,  # International Students - 5%
    'SCORE_ISD': 0.00, # International Student Diversity - 0%
    'SCORE_IRN': 0.05, # International Research Network - 5%
    'SCORE_EO': 0.05,  # Employment Outcomes - 5%
    'SCORE_ST': 0.05,  # Sustainability - 5%
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Current Rankings Analysis
- **Scenario 1**: Improving Academic Reputation from 34.3 to 50.0
- **Scenario 2**: Enhancing International Profile across multiple indicators
- **Scenario 3**: Research Excellence through Citations per Faculty improvements
